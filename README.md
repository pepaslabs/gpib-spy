# Thanks

Thanks to [Steven Casagrande](http://steven.casagrande.io/) of [Galvant Industries](https://github.com/Galvant) for [releasing](https://github.com/Galvant/gpibusb-pcb) his [GPIB-to-USB adapter](http://www.galvant.ca/) as open source hardware.  Using a few of his KiCAD footprints saved me a lot of time!
